deep learning/machine learning is for:
-complex problem with LOTS of rules (ie. pathfinding for cars)
-problems with changing enviroments (ie. miniMaze,facial recognition)
-problems with a large collection of data

what DL/ML is NOT good for:
-problem that need to be throuhly explained
-problem with low amount of data
-when traditional approach is better(just do it instead)
-when error are unacceptable(dl/ml works,but will have a few fails from its unpredictability)


    //if it can be turned into numbers and values,AI can solve it//

difference between ML and DL

neural networks
1.input (data goes in)
2.hidden layers(node layers of relationship and recognition to sort out stuff)
3.output(pop goes the answer)

use case of DL
-sequence to sequence(ie.translation,speech recognition)
-classification/regression(ie.computer vision,NPL)
